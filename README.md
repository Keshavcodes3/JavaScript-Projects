📦 JavaScript Projects Collection

A bold collection of practical JavaScript projects, built to strengthen fundamentals like DOM manipulation, async programming, APIs, events, and clean UI development using Tailwind.

This repository tracks my daily grind, building real-world mini-apps without frameworks to deepen core understanding.

🔥 What’s Inside

Each project is isolated with its own HTML, Tailwind (or minimal CSS), and JavaScript.


New projects are added regularly as part of my consistency and growth routine.

🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Build real functional apps, not toy snippets

Master async JS & API handling

Strengthen DOM skills

Write cleaner, modular code

Improve debugging without depending on frameworks

Maintain a strong GitHub activity trail

🛠️ Tech Stack
