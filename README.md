📦 JavaScript Projects Collection

A bold collection of practical JavaScript projects, built to strengthen fundamentals like DOM manipulation, async programming, APIs, events, and clean UI development using Tailwind.

This repository tracks my daily grind, building real-world mini-apps without frameworks to deepen core understanding.

🔥 What’s Inside

Each project is isolated with its own HTML, Tailwind (or minimal CSS), and JavaScript.
